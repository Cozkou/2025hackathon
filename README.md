# StudenTools ðŸ“š

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
StudenTools is an innovative academic platform that combines four powerful AI-driven tools to enhance student learning. At its core, it features a smart calendar system that finds optimal study times between lectures and manages revision schedules. The platform includes a dynamic past paper generator that creates custom practice materials when you run out of past papers, an AI-powered flashcard system that converts lecture materials into effective study aids, and a unique TeachBack feature where students reinforce their understanding by teaching concepts to an AI with adjustable intelligence levels.

Our mission is simple: provide students with focused, AI-powered tools that make a real difference in their academic journey. Whether it's finding the perfect study slot, generating practice materials, or strengthening knowledge through teaching, StudenTools streamlines the learning process with modern technology.

## ðŸ”Œ Portia.ai Integration
We leveraged Portia.ai's powerful capabilities for our calendar integration tool, making it a cornerstone of our smart scheduling system:

1. **Intelligent Calendar Management**: Used Portia's Google Calendar API to seamlessly integrate with students' schedules
   ```python
   portia:google:gcalendar:create_event(event_title, event_description, start_time, end_time)
   ```

2. **Smart Time Slot Detection**: Utilized Portia's natural language processing to find optimal study periods
 

3. **Automated Session Scheduling**: Implemented Portia's event creation capabilities to automatically schedule and manage study sessions
